phpBB3 Raid Signup System
=========================

Introduction
------------
phpBB3 is a drop-in addon for phpBB3 that adds a raid signup system to the forum.
This is not a plugin, it simply makes use of some of the parts of phpBB3.

Licensing
---------
This software is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL v3

Getting started
---------------
Installing the raid system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install this system, place the raid.php file in your top level phpBB3 folder.
raid_includes should also go in this folder, unless you want to go through and change a lot of paths.

To inject the system into the forum site, a template is needed.
I have supplied a template for the world of warcraft theme "m9wowhbb3".
If you are using a different theme, you will have to change this as appropriate.
Please submit additional templates for inclusion on github.

You will also need to add a link to raid.php somewhere on the site so your members can find it without manually typing the address.

I've opted to do so in styles/m9wowhbb3/template/breadcrumbs.html:
<p class="breadcrumbs"><a href="{U_RAIDSIGNUP}">Raid signups</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

and in includes/functions.php;
function page_header($page_title = '', $display_online_list = true)
	...
	$template->assign_vars(array(
		...
		'U_RAIDSIGNUP' => append_sid("{$phpbb_root_path}raid.$phpEx"),
		...

For simplicity, you can opt to just put /phpBB3/raid.php instead of {U_RAIDSIGNUP} in your link.
But users without cookies might experience issues.

Setting up phpBB3 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The raid system expects that phpBB3 have at least 2 groups that denote raid system access.
It also requires the user profiles to contain three additional fields; character name, role and class.

To add these profile fields, go into the administration control panel, under Users and Groups to find Custom profile fields.
The default names are main_char_name, role and class.
main_char_name should be a single text field, while role and class should be dropdown boxes.

For role, these are the original entries as used by the author:
none
DPS
Tank
Healer

And for class;
none
Death Knight
Druid
Hunter
Mage
Paladin
Priest
Rogue
Shaman
Warlock
Warrior

Expanding the database schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The raid signup system requires a few database tables to work.
These are all contained in the included schema.sql script.

Configuring the raid system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All configuration exists in the top level raid.php file, in the form of an array.
Each set of options have comments detailing what they do.

You should at a very minimum change the three *_group settings. 
These should be the textual name your phpBB3 roles have.

Using the raid signup system
----------------------------
Setting up raids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any user whom are a member of the group given as the admin_group in raid.php have access to create new raids.
To add a new raid, simply go into the raid system and click "create raid"

If raids already exist, the date boxes will be automatically filled according to the ruleset in raid.php
You also have the option of auto-creating raids for an entire month.

If you untick "include in statistics", the attendance for your raid will not be taken into account.

Signing up to raids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any users whom are memebers of the group you set as the raider_group option, will be able to sign up to raids.
If a user tries entering the raid signup system, but he or she is missing one of the three additional profile fields, 
the user will be shown a error message and directed to the user control panel.

The front page of the raid signup system displays several lists;
New raids, facilitating quickly signing up to all upcoming raids.
Expired raids this month, with attendance status for each.
Upcoming raids this month, with sign up buttons and a message to the organizers.

There is also a calendar to allow navigation between months and visualize raid days.

If there are no more upcoming raids for the selected month, the expired raids list will take the place of the upcoming raids list, making it bugger.

Checking attendance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The menu item "attendance" bringsup a list of every registered raider, with statistics about attendance.
You can hover each header for a more descriptive text about a given column.
First, the report shows the three signing options, in, 50/50 and out. beneath that, each has a column S (signed up) and A (attended)
Next, the report shows a summary.

Clicking the radio button at the end of any line brings up a SVG graph of the attendance of that person.
By clicking their name instead, you get a html table of the same data as shown in the graph.
This page also has a link to their armory page.

Vacations
~~~~~~~~~
Raiders can go into the "absences" section and record their planned vacations ahead of time.
Any raids that get created during such periods, will automatically record any raiders with an absence as "out".
